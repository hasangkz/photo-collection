# Photo Collection

# I developed a photo collection with Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB.

+ Express.js
+ MongoDB
+ mongoose
+ ejs


## About my app
I have developed an application where people can easily upload their pictures, write captions and descriptions on their pictures and collect their memories.
in this project i made use of an already existing css file.
People will be able to correct the uploaded pictures at any time or delete them when they give up the picture.
I used MongoDB as database and of course I took advantage of the goodies of Express.js. :)
In order for my app to be valid on all devices, I completed this by simulating a post request, as not all browsers support the put request.


# here are the images from my app:
